## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

This project implements a minimal **HTTP/1.0 file server** and a simple **HTTP client** written from scratch using Pythonâ€™s `socket` module.

The goal is to understand the HTTP request/response cycle, directory indexing, content-type handling, and concurrency via multi-threading.

The setup runs fully in **Docker containers** (server + client) managed via **Docker Compose**.
